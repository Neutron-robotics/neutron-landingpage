# Create a Robot

Within the platform, a robot is more than a mere machine; it's a digital entity composed of:

* **Name:** A unique identifier for your robot.
* **Description:** A brief overview of its purpose and capabilities.
* **Parts:** The building blocks that define its functionality, encompassing sensors, actuators, and physical elements.

From the robot's dedicated section, you can delve into its history, explore its component list, and monitor its current status. However, a crucial prerequisite for accessing its activity logs is the establishment of a link between the robot and the agent.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to the Robots Section:**
   Begin by accessing the "Robots" section within the platform's interface. This serves as your central hub for managing all robot-related operations.

2. **Click the "Create Robot" Button:**
   
   Locate and click the prominent "Create Robot" button, usually positioned at the top of the "Robots" section. This action will initiate the robot creation process.

3. **Fill in the Robot Details:**

   A form will appear, prompting you to provide essential information about your robot. This includes:
      * **Name:** Choose a descriptive and unique name that reflects your robot's identity.
      * **Description:** Offer a concise overview of your robot's purpose, functionalities, and any other relevant details.

4. **Save Your Robot:**
   Once you've filled in all the required details and defined the robot's parts, click the "Save" button to finalize the creation process. Your newly created robot will now appear in the "Robots" section.

5. **Define Robot Parts:**

   In this section, you'll define the individual parts that constitute your robot. Each part should be categorized as either a sensor, an actuator, or a physical element. For each part, specify:
      * **Type:** Choose from sensor, actuator, or physical element.
      * **Name:** Provide a descriptive name for the part.
      * **Description:** Elaborate on the part's function within the robot's overall operation.

## Additional Notes

* **Linking to an Agent:** To enable activity tracking for your robot, remember to link it to its corresponding agent. This connection allows the platform to record and display the robot's actions and interactions.
* **Editing Robot Details:** If you need to modify any details or parts of your robot later on, you can easily do so by accessing its dedicated section and making the necessary edits.
* **Deleting Robots:** Should you decide to remove a robot from the platform, you can do so by accessing its section and choosing the delete option.

By following these steps and understanding the essential components of a robot's digital representation, you'll be well-equipped to create, manage, and utilize robots effectively within the platform's ecosystem.
