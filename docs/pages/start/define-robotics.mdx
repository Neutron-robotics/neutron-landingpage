### Step 3: Define Your Robotic Systems ðŸ¤–

In this crucial step, you'll bring your robots to life within the Neutron platform. This involves not only adding them to your project but also describing their unique characteristics and capabilities.

1. **Navigate to the Robots Section:** From your project overview, click on the "Robots" section. This is where you'll manage everything related to your robotic fleet. [PLACEHOLDER_ROBOTS_SECTION_IMAGE]

2. **Add a New Robot:** Click the "Add Robot" button, usually prominently displayed. You'll be presented with options to define your robot:
   * **Robot Name:** Choose a clear, identifiable name for your robot.
   * **Robot Type:** Select the appropriate type from a list of options (e.g., wheeled robot, robotic arm, drone).
   * **Communication Protocol:** Specify how your robot communicates (e.g., ROS, WebSocket, Modbus). This is essential for Neutron to establish a connection. [PLACEHOLDER_ADD_ROBOT_FORM_IMAGE]

3. **Robot Configuration:** Depending on your chosen communication protocol, you might need to provide additional details, such as:
    * **IP Address/Hostname:** If your robot is on a network, you'll need to enter its address.
    * **Port:** The communication port your robot uses.
    * **Topics/Services:** For ROS robots, you'll need to list the ROS topics or services you want to interact with.

4. **Robot Description (Optional):** You can add a brief description of your robot, noting its purpose, features, or any other relevant information. [PLACEHOLDER_ROBOT_DESCRIPTION_IMAGE]

5. **Save Your Robot:** Once you've filled in all the necessary details, click "Save" (or a similar button). Your robot will now appear in the list of robots in your project.

6. **Repeat for Additional Robots:** If you have more than one robot, repeat this process for each one.
