# Advanced Layout

Once you have selected a Graph Package and linked your robot, you can start building your interface. Neutron provides a wide range of UI components that you can use to create a custom layout that meets your specific needs. These components include:

* **Buttons:** Trigger specific actions or commands on your robot.
* **Sliders:** Adjust parameters or settings in real time.
* **Graphs:** Visualize data from your robot's sensors or actuators.
* **Camera Feeds:** Monitor your robot's environment.
* **And more:** Neutron offers a variety of other UI components that you can use to create a comprehensive control interface.

To add a UI component to your layout, simply drag and drop it from the component library onto the canvas. You can then resize and reposition the component as needed. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of each component to match your preferences.

Once you have created a layout that you are satisfied with, you can save it as a "Layout." This will allow you to easily reuse the layout in the future. To save a layout, click the "Save Layout" button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the layout. Once you have saved the layout, you can access it from the "Layouts" menu.

Layouts are a powerful way to create custom control interfaces for your robots. By saving and reusing layouts, you can quickly and easily switch between different control configurations for different tasks. This can save you time and effort, and it can also help you to create more consistent and user-friendly control interfaces.
