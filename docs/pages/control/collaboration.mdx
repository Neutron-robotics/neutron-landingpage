### Collaborate

Neutron Robotics allows multiple users to join the same connection and control the robot simultaneously. This feature is particularly valuable for tasks that require coordination or shared decision-making. To optimize data transfer and prevent overloading the robot, Neutron intelligently routes traffic through a forward proxy, ensuring smooth communication even with multiple users.

1.  **Join a Connection:**
    *   To join an existing connection, click on the "Join" button next to the connection name in the connection list.
    *   You will be prompted to enter a name for yourself. This name will be visible to other users in the connection.
    *   Once you have joined, you will be able to see the robot's status and control it alongside other users.

2.  **Control the Robot:**
    *   When multiple users are connected, the robot's controls will be shared.
    *   The user who initiated the connection (the admin) will have priority control.
    *   Other users can request control from the admin, or the admin can grant control to another user.

3.  **View Robot Status:**
    *   All users in the connection will be able to see the robot's status, including its position, sensor readings, and camera feeds.
    *   This shared view allows for better coordination and decision-making.

4.  **Communicate with Other Users:**
    *   Neutron Robotics does not currently have a built-in chat feature.
    *   However, you can use external communication tools (e.g., Slack, Discord) to coordinate with other users in the connection.

5.  **Leave a Connection:**
    *   To leave a connection, click on the "Leave" button next to the connection name in the connection list.
    *   You will be disconnected from the robot and will no longer be able to control it or see its status.

**Note:** The admin user can also end the connection for all users by clicking on the "End" button. This will disconnect all users and stop the robot.
