* **Guest:** Guests have the most limited permissions. They can view basic information about the robots but cannot access the dashboard, control robots, or modify configurations.
* **Operator:** Operators have additional access to the dashboard and can control robots in real time. However, they cannot modify robot configurations.
* **Analyst:** Analysts can do everything that operators can, plus they have the ability to update robot configurations. They also have access to analytics tools on the dashboard for in-depth analysis.
* **Admin:** Admins have the highest level of permissions, except for ownership. They can perform all the tasks that analysts can, plus they can manage user permissions within the team.
* **Owner:** The owner has full control over the team, including managing user permissions and all other aspects of team management.

**Important:**

* Be sure to assign roles carefully to ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access.
* The owner cannot modify their own role or the role of other owners.

By understanding and managing user roles effectively, you can create a collaborative and secure environment for your team.
