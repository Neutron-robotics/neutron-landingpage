**Description:**

The Subscriber Node allows your robot to listen for messages on a specific ROS2 topic. It acts as a receiver of information, capturing data published by other nodes on the designated topic. This node is essential for receiving sensor data, commands, or other types of information within your ROS2-based robot system.

**Settings Parameters:**

*   **Topic:** Specify the name of the ROS2 topic you want to subscribe to (e.g., `/scan`).

**Input:**

*   (None) The Subscriber Node does not have any explicit input connections. It receives messages directly from the ROS2 topic.

**Output:**

*   `msg`: The message object received from the ROS2 topic. The structure of this object will depend on the topic's message type.
