**Type:** Function

**Compatible with:** Flow Graph, Connector Graph

**Description:**

The Switch Node acts as a conditional router for messages, directing them to different outputs based on the value of a specified property or their position in a sequence. This node enables dynamic decision-making within your flows, allowing you to create branching logic based on various conditions.


**Settings Parameters (Rules):**

*   **Property:** The dot-notation path to the property within the `msg` object that you want to evaluate (e.g., `msg.payload.status`). Alternatively, you can select "env." to evaluate an environment variable.
*   **Comparison Operator:**  Choose a comparison operator (e.g. == != > < contains, regex) to define the matching condition.
*   **Value/Pattern:** Enter the value or pattern to compare against the property.  For "contains" and "regex," enter a string or regular expression.
*   **Output:** Select the output port (1, 2, etc.) to which the message should be sent if the rule matches.


**Additional Settings:**

*   **Verify all the rules:** Evaluates all rules and sends the message to all matching outputs.
*   **Stops when match:** Stops evaluating rules as soon as one rule matches and sends the message to the corresponding output.

**Input:**

*   `msg`: The message object whose property will be evaluated against the defined rules.

**Outputs:**

*   Multiple outputs (1, 2, etc.), each corresponding to a specific rule.
