## Inject Node (Flow Graph)

<Image src="/screenshot/node-inject.png" alt="Inject Node UI" width={200} height={200} />

**Type:** Flow Control

**Compatible with:** Flow Graph

**Description:**

The Inject Node is a versatile tool for initiating flows or introducing data at specific intervals within a Flow Graph. It allows you to manually trigger events or set up automatic injections based on intervals or cron schedules. The payload of the injected message can be a variety of types, including strings, numbers, objects, or even dynamically generated data.

**Settings Parameters:**

*   **Payload:**
    *   **Type:** Select the data type of the payload (e.g., String, Number, JSON).
    *   **Value:**  Enter the actual payload data or a valid expression for the selected type.
*   **Topic:** (Optional) Specify a topic for the injected message (useful for filtering in other nodes).
*   **Repeat:**
    *   **Interval:** Inject messages at regular intervals.
    *   **Cron:** Inject messages based on a cron schedule.
    *   **None:** Inject only once when manually triggered or at the start of the flow (if configured).
*   **Interval/Cron Configuration:**  If using "Interval" or "Cron," configure the interval duration or cron expression accordingly.

**Input:**

*   (None) The Inject Node does not have any input connections.

**Output:**

*   `msg`: The message object with the defined payload and topic.

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Configure Payload:** Choose the data type and enter the payload value.
2.  **Set Repeat Mode:** Select "Interval," "Cron," or "None" depending on your injection requirements.
3.  **Configure Interval/Cron:** If applicable, set the interval duration or cron expression.
4.  **Connect Node:** Connect the output of the Inject Node to the input of another node in your flow.
5.  **(Optional) Manual Trigger:** In debug mode, click the button on the node to manually inject a message.

**Tips:**

*   Use the Inject Node to simulate sensor data, trigger specific actions, or start complex sequences of events.
*   The flexibility of the payload type allows you to inject a wide range of data, from simple values to complex objects.
*   Experiment with different repeat modes to create dynamic and responsive behaviors in your robot applications.
