<Image src="/screenshot/node-service.png" alt="Service Node UI" width={200} height={200} />

**Type:** ROS2

**Compatible with:** Flow Graph, Connector Graph

**Description:**

The Service Node enables your robot to interact with ROS2 services. Services provide a request-response communication mechanism, allowing you to send a request to a service server and receive a corresponding response. This node is useful for triggering specific actions, retrieving data from other nodes, or performing on-demand computations.

**Settings Parameters:**

*   **Service:** Specify the name of the ROS2 service you want to interact with (e.g., `/get_map`).

**Input:**

*   `msg.payload`: The request message payload you want to send to the service server. The structure of this payload should conform to the service definition.

**Output:**

*   `msg.payload`: The response message payload received from the service server. The structure of this payload will depend on the specific service definition.
