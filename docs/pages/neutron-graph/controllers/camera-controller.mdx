<Image src="/screenshot/node-cameracontroller.png" alt="Camera Controller Node UI" width={200} height={200} />

**Type:** Connector

**Compatible with:** Connector Graph

**Description:**

The Camera Controller Node is designed to manage the activation and deactivation of a camera (or camera stream) on your robot. It interfaces with user input from a graphical interface (e.g., a button or toggle switch) and translates it into commands to control the camera's state.

**Key Features:**

*   **User Input Driven:** Similar to other connector nodes, the Camera Controller Node does not require manual configuration. Its behavior is determined by user interactions with the linked UI element.
*   **Event-Based Triggering:** This node triggers an event each time the associated UI element is interacted with, indicating whether the camera should be turned on or off.
*   **Simplified Camera Control:** It abstracts the complexities of camera hardware and communication, providing a straightforward way to manage the camera's state through your interface.

**Input:**

*   (None) The input is not received through a traditional node connection but directly from the user interacting with the linked UI element in the graphical interface.

**Output:**

*   `msg`:  An object with a single property `state`, which can be either "on" or "off," indicating the desired camera state.

```json
{
  "state": "on" | "off"
}
