<Image src="/screenshot/node-rtccamera.png" alt="RTC Camera Controller Node UI" width={200} height={200} />

**Type:** Connector

**Compatible with:** Connector Graph

**Description:**

The RTC Camera Controller Node facilitates real-time video streaming from your robot's camera to the Neutron interface. It establishes a WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) connection with a specified host, enabling low-latency video transmission directly within your browser.

**Settings Parameters:**

*   **Host:** The IP address or hostname of the WebRTC server running on your robot.

**Input:**

*   (None) The node does not have any explicit input connections. It receives video data directly from the WebRTC connection.

**Output:**

*   (None) The node does not have any explicit output connections. It renders the received video stream directly in the associated UI element within the Neutron interface.

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Configure Host:** Enter the correct IP address or hostname of your robot's WebRTC server in the "Host" parameter.
2.  **Add to Interface:** Drag and drop the RTC Camera Controller Node onto your Connector Graph.
3.  **Link to UI Element:** Connect the node to a Video UI element in your interface.
4.  **View Video Stream:** If the connection is successful, the video stream from your robot's camera will be displayed in the linked Video UI element.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **WebRTC Server:** Ensure that a compatible WebRTC server is running on your robot and configured to accept connections from the Neutron interface.
*   **Network Connectivity:** A stable network connection between your robot and the Neutron interface is crucial for smooth video streaming.
*   **Firewall/NAT:** If your robot is behind a firewall or NAT, you may need to configure port forwarding or other network settings to allow incoming WebRTC connections.
