## Neutron Graphs: Your Visual Programming Powerhouse for Robot Control

Neutron Graphs are at the heart of Neutron Robotics, providing an intuitive visual interface to design and orchestrate complex robot behaviors. Whether you're a seasoned roboticist or just starting, Neutron Graphs empower you to create sophisticated control logic without writing a single line of code.

### Two Flavors of Graphs: Client-Side and Server-Side

Neutron offers two distinct types of graphs, each tailored for specific use cases:

1.  **Connector Graphs (Client-Side):** These graphs run entirely within your web browser, making them perfect for real-time interactions and data processing. They excel at tasks like:
    *   Parsing and transforming incoming data from your robot's sensors.
    *   Creating interactive UI elements that respond instantly to user input.
    *   Visualizing sensor data in real time.

2.  **Flow Graphs (Server-Side):** These graphs reside on the Neutron server, enabling them to handle resource-intensive tasks and maintain continuous control over your robot. They are ideal for:
    *   Implementing autonomous behaviors and decision-making logic.
    *   Managing complex sequences of actions and responses.
    *   Integrating with external systems and services.

### The Building Blocks of Your Robot's Brain

Think of Neutron Graphs as the building blocks of your robot's "brain." Each graph is a network of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a specific operation or function. You can drag and drop nodes onto the canvas, connect them with wires, and configure their parameters to create your desired behavior.

### A World of Possibilities

With Neutron Graphs, the possibilities are endless. You can create graphs to control a single motor, orchestrate a swarm of drones, or anything in between. The intuitive visual interface makes it easy to experiment, iterate, and refine your robot's behavior until it's just right.
